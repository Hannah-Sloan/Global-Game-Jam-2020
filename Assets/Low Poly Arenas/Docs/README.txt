The package should be structure in folders that are easy to understand.

Under \Low Poly Arenas\Colosseum\Prefabs you can find all the meshes setup for you to drag and drop into your projects.

The skybox uses a .dds file in the material.
Material location -  \Low Poly Arenas\Colosseum\Materials\Skybox.mat
The .dds file is zipped as Unity doesn't allow .dds files to be uploaded to packages. You can find the .zip file for the .dds file here: http://wireddevelopments.com/downloads/skybox.zip
Once downloaded extract that file into the textures folder (\Low Poly Arenas\Colosseum\Textures\) and then add that .dds file to the skybox material here: \Low Poly Arenas\Colosseum\Materials\Skybox.mat
The skybox material should be using "Skybox/Cubemap"
