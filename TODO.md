# TODO
## A list of tasks to be completed

### FIX KICKBACK 
wth why is kick back so high 0.0
WHY IS KICKBACK SO HIGH!?
does kickback not apply upward or is gravity just that strong?
I TOOK THE MOD OFF WHAT IS THIS KICKBACK??!?!?!?!?

### Priority 1
fix 'ui' scaling
what is up with break chance? 100% destroy chance should be much lower 0^0
add hit animation
add damage animation
Pool lightning/Fire particle effect for less performance hit
Give AI less health, make sure enough spawn

### Priority 2
add level up notification
Have enemies actually do something to you
Denote level of orb (mod) (brightness?)

### Priority 3
Make orbs despawn - crowded play area is overwhelming
Leave blood & Dead bodies around

### Priority 4
add removing mods from inventory space
add better broken notification
add animations
add music
add sfx
add intro explaining the goal is break the fps - set theme
Add Level up bar
Add health bars
Add mod stacking
Fix Red mod stacking
Label gun sections
Include visual modification of gun
increase max pointlight count (or maybe not performance is bad enough as it is)

### "Quick" Fixes
Don't start the ammo crazy high if add ons significantly lower it
remove weird copypasta as default text
add coliders to enviroment
maybe make distribution of mod drop types more consistent? aka dont drop same type (color type) twice
why are bullets spawned in the always on scene?
slow ai
add real quit button
what is ping debug?
Copy over red orb touchups to other orbs

### Questions
no good reload upgrades
I think when you 'replace' what is in an inventory slot you delete what you're picking up
bug where you can 'drop' not drop a mod in mid ui
Should shooting 68 bullets take 68 ammo??
