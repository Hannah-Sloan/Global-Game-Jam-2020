# TODO
## A list of tasks to be completed

### FIX KICKBACK 
Currently the 'fix' is to just not spawn kickback mods

similar to how we do not spawn knockback mods
- wth why is kick back so high 0.0
- WHY IS KICKBACK SO HIGH!?
- does kickback not apply upward or is gravity just that strong?
- I TOOK THE MOD OFF WHAT IS THIS KICKBACK??!?!?!?!?

### Priority 1
- add hit animation
- add damage animation
- Pool lightning/Fire particle effect for less performance hit

### Priority 2
- add level up notification
- Have enemies actually do something to you
- Denote level of orb (mod) (brightness?)

### Priority 3
- Make orbs despawn - crowded play area is overwhelming
- Leave blood & Dead bodies around
- Pickup orbs while on the move

### Priority 4
- add removing mods from inventory space
- add better broken notification
- add animations
- add music
- add sfx
- add intro explaining the goal is break the fps - set theme
- Add Level up bar
- Add health bars
- Add mod stacking
- Fix Red mod stacking
- Label gun sections
- Include visual modification of gun
- increase max pointlight count (or maybe not performance is bad enough as it is)
- Kill / Do damage on head jump
- R to reload early

### "Quick" Fixes
- maybe make distribution of mod drop types more consistent? aka dont drop same type (color type) twice
- add real quit button
- Copy over red orb touchups to other orbs

### Questions
- no good reload upgrades
- I think when you 'replace' what is in an inventory slot you delete what you're picking up
- bug where you can 'drop' not drop a mod in mid ui
- Should shooting 68 bullets take 68 ammo??
